This  European  Union  Public  Licence  (the “EUPL”)  applies  to  the Work  or  Software 
(as defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the 
Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use 
is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work). 

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as 
defined  below)  has  placed  the  following  notice  immediately  following  the  copyright 
notice for the Original Work: 

                      Licensed under the EUPL V.1.1

Code as the case may be. 

-  Derivative  Works:  the  works  or  software  that  could  be  created  by  the  Licensee, 
based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define 
the  extent  of  modification  or  dependence  on  the  Original  Work  required  in  order  to 
classify  a  work  as  a  Derivative  Work;  this  extent  is  determined  by  copyright  law 
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15. 

- The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works. 

-  The  Source  Code:  the  human-readable  form  of  the  Work  which  is  the

Work under the Licence. 

-  Contributor(s):  any  natural  or  legal  person  who  modifies  the  Work

-  The  Licensee or “You”: any  natural  or  legal  person  who  makes  any  usage  of 
the Software under the terms of the Licence. 

-  Distribution and/or  Communication:  any  act  of  selling,  giving,  lending,  renting, 
distributing,  communicating,  transmitting,  or  otherwise  making  available,  on-line  or 
off-line,  copies  of  the  Work  or  providing  access  to  its  essential  functionalities  at  the 
disposal of any other natural or legal person. 

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The  Licensor  hereby  grants  You  a  world-wide,  royalty-free,  non-exclusive,
sub-licensable  licence  to  do  the  following,  for  the  duration  of  copyright  vested  in  the 
Original Work: 

-use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
-reproduce the Work, 
-modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, 
-communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the 
Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be,
the Work, 
-distribute the Work or copies thereof, 
-lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, 
-sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. 

Those  rights  can  be  exercised  on  any  media,  supports  and  formats,  whether  now 
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. 

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his 
moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the 
economic rights here above listed.

The  Licensor  grants  to  the  Licensee  royalty-free,
non  exclusive  usage  rights  to  any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent
necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work under this Licence. 

3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable 
Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a 
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the 
Work  that  the  Licensor  distributes  or  indicates,  in  a  notice  following  the  copyright 
notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source  Code is easily and freely 
accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing  in  this  Licence is  intended  to  deprive  the Licensee  of  the  benefits  from  any 
exception  or  limitation  to  the  exclusive  rights  of the  rights  owners  in  the  Original 
Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations 
thereto. 

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations 
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: 

Attribution  right:  the  Licensee  shall  keep  intact  all  copyright,  pate
nt  or  trademarks notices  and  all  notices  that  refer  to  the  Licence
and  to  the  disclaimer  of  warranties. The  Licensee  must  include  a  copy  of  such  notices
and  a  copy  of  the  Licence  with every  copy  of  the  Work  he/she  distributes  and/or
communicates.  The  Licensee  must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices
stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. 

Copyleft  clause:   If  the  Licensee  distributes  and/or  communicates  copies  of  the 
Original Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution 
and/or  Communication  will  be  done  under  the  terms  of  this  Licence  or  of  a  later 
version  of  this  Licence  unless  the  Original  Work  is  expressly  distributed  only  under 
this version of the Licence. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose 
any  additional  terms  or  conditions  on  the  Work  or  Derivative  Work  that  alter  or 
restrict the terms of the Licence. 

Compatibility  clause:  If  the  Licensee  Distributes  and/or  Communicates  Derivative 
Works  or  copies  thereof  based  upon  both  the  Original  Work  and  another  work 
licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be 
done  under  the  terms  of  this  Compatible  Licence.  For  the  sake  of  this  clause, 
“Compatible  Licence”  refers  to  the  licences  listed in  the  appendix  attached  to  this 
Licence.  Should  the  Licensee’s  obligations  under  the  Compatible  Licence  conflict 
with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence 
shall prevail. 

Provision  of  Source  Code:  When  distributing  and/or  communicating  copies  of  the 
Work,  the  Licensee  will  provide  a  machine-readable copy  of  the  Source  Code  or 
indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long 
as the Licensee continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. 

Legal  Protection:  This  Licence  does  not  grant  permission  to  use  the trade  names, 
trademarks,   service   marks,   or   names   of   the   Licensor,   except   as   required   for 
reasonable  and  customary  use  in  describing  the  origin  of  the  Work  and  reproducing 
the content of the copyright notice. 

6. Chain of Authorship

The  original  Licensor  warrants  that  the  copyright  in  the  Original  Work  granted 
hereunder  is  owned  by  him/her  or  licensed  to  him/her  and  that  he/she  has  the  power 
and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work
are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to
grant the Licence. 

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors 
grant  You  a  licence  to  their  contributions  to  the  Work,  under  the  terms  of  this 
Licence. 

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The  Work  is  a  work  in  progress,  which  is  continuously  improved  by  numerous 
contributors.  It  is  not  a  finished  work  and  may  therefore  contain  defects  or  “bugs” 
inherent to this type of software development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis and without
warranties  of  any  kind  concerning  the  Work, including  without  limitation merchantability,
fitness   for   a   particular   purpose, absence   of   defects   or   errors, accuracy,
non-infringement  of  intellectual  property rights  other  than  copyright
as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. 

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the 
grant of any rights to the Work. 

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except  in  the  cases  of  wilful  misconduct  or  damages  directly  caused  to  natural 
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or 
moral,  damages  of  any  kind,  arising  out  of  the  Licence  or  of  the  use  of  the  Work, 
including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure  or  malfunction,  loss  of  data  or  any  commercial  damage,  even  if  the  Licensor 
has  been  advised  of  the  possibility  of  such  damage.  However,  the  Licensor  will  be 
liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work. 

9. Additional agreements

While  distributing  the  Original  Work  or  Derivative Works,  You  may  choose  to 
conclude an additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, 
warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this 
Licence.  However,  in  accepting  such  obligations,  You  may  act  only  on  your  own 
behalf  and  on  your  sole  responsibility,  not  on  behalf  of  the  original  Licensor  or  any 
other  Contributor,  and  only  if  You  agree  to  indemnify,  defend,  and  hold  each 
Contributor  harmless  for  any  liability  incurred  by,  or  claims  asserted  against  such 
Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such warranty or additional liability. 

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The  provisions  of  this  Licence  can  be  accepted  by  clicking  on  an  icon  “I  agree” 
placed  under  the  bottom  of  a  window  displaying  the text  of  this  Licence  or  by 
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable 
law.  Clicking  on  that  icon  indicates  your  clear  and irrevocable  acceptance  of  this 
Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly,  you  irrevocably  accept  this  Licence  and all  of  its  terms  and  conditions
by exercising  any  rights  granted  to  You  by  Article  2 of  this  Licence,  such  as  the
use of the  Work,  the  creation  by  You  of  a  Derivative  Work or  the  Distribution  and/or
Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic 
communication  by  You  (for  example,  by  offering  to  download  the  Work  from  a 
remote  location)  the  distribution  channel  or  media (for  example,  a  website)  must  at 
least provide to  the  public the information requested by the applicable law regarding 
the  Licensor,  the  Licence  and  the  way  it  may  be  accessible,  concluded,  stored  and 
reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence

The  Licence  and  the  rights  granted  hereunder  will  terminate  automatically  upon  any 
breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work  from  the
Licensee  under  the  Licence,  provided such  persons  remain  in  full compliance with the Licence.  

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement 
between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. 

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this 
will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision 
will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions and/or new versions 
of  this  Licence,  so  far  this  is  required and  reasonable,  without  reducing  the  scope  of 
the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with 
a unique version number.

All  linguistic  versions  of  this  Licence, approved  by  the European  Commission,  have identical value.
Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice. 

14. Jurisdiction

Any  litigation  resulting  from  the  interpretation  of this  License,  arising  between  the 
European  Commission,  as  a  Licensor,  and  any  Licensee,  will  be  subject  to  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Communities,  as  laid  down  in 
article 238 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 

Any  litigation  arising  between  Parties,  other  than the  European  Commission,  and 
resulting  from  the  interpretation  of  this  License, will  be  subject  to  the  exclusive 
jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary 
business. 

15. Applicable Law

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the 
Licensor resides or has his registered office.

This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if:

-a  litigation  arises  between  the  European  Commission,  as  a  Licensor,  and  any 
Licensee; 

-the  Licensor,  other  than  the  European  Commission,  has  no  residence  or 
registered office inside a European Union country.

        royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
        Licensed Material to:
            A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use,
        this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.
        
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
        
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the
        Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make
        technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
        any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the
        Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.
        For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never
        produces Adapted Material.
        
        5. Downstream recipients.
            A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
            receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions
            of this Public License.
            
            B. Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
            automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted
            Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.
            
            C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or
            conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
            so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
        
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or
        imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed,
        or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
        Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

    b. Other rights.
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
        privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
        and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow
        You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
        
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
        
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the
        Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory
        or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect
        such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

    a. Attribution.

        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
            
            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
                
                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive
                attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
                
                ii. a copyright notice;
                
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
                
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
                
                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;
            
            B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
            
            C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of,
            or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means,
        and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
        conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
        
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A)
        to the extent reasonably practicable.
    
    b. ShareAlike.

    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following
    conditions also apply.
    
        1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements,
        this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
        
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may
        satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You
        Share Adapted Material.
        
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective
        Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the
        Adapter's License You apply.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all
    or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;
    
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have
    Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
    (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
    
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the
    contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this
Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the
    Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
    the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation,
    warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent
    or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.
    Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    
    b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including,
    without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
    punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use
    of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs,
    expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation
    may not apply to You.

    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that,
    to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You
    fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your
        discovery of the violation; or
        
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies
    for Your violations of this Public License.
    
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions
    or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
    
    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.
